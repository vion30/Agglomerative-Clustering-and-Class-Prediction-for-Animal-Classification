# Agglomerative Clustering and Class Prediction for Animal   Classification
## Overview

This project utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques to classify animals based on their attributes. By leveraging the zoo.csv dataset, the goal is to perform agglomerative clustering and compute the mean squared error (MSE) by comparing predicted and actual high-level animal classes. This project is part of the Data Science and Machine Learning Program.


## Key Features

* Data Exploration: Loaded and explored the dataset to understand 
  its structure and features.
* Unique Class Identification: Identified the unique high-level  
  animal classes from the dataset.
* Agglomerative Clustering: Applied hierarchical clustering to    
  classify animals using their features.
* Model Evaluation: Computed the mean squared error (MSE) between 
  actual and predicted classes to evaluate clustering performance.
## Technology Used

* Programming Languages: Python
* Libraries:
   - pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
   - numpy: For numerical computations.
   - scikit-learn: For implementing agglomerative clustering and 
     evaluating performance.
   - matplotlib/seaborn: For visualizing data and clustering 
     results.


## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/animal-clustering.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd animal-clustering
## Run

1. Open the project directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

   jupyter notebook Agglomerative Clustering and Class Prediction 
   for Animal Classification Project.ipynb

2. Open the Agglomerative Clustering and Class Prediction for   
   Animal Classification Project.ipynb file and run the cells   
   sequentially to execute the analysis.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of agglomerative clustering for classifying animals based on intermediate features. While the unsupervised approach yields meaningful groupings, further improvements can be made by:

- Refining feature selection for better classification.
- Comparing clustering results with other algorithms like K-Means or DBSCAN.
- Incorporating dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA for enhanced clustering.
